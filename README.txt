Post to Twitter is a plugin that creates a complete integration between your WordPress blog and your Twitter account.

== Details ==

Post to Twitter integrates with Twitter by giving you the following functionality:

* Create a tweet on Twitter whenever you post in your blog, with a link to the blog post


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'post-to-twitter.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Post to Twitter.
4. Go to the Post to Twitter Options page (Options > Post to Twitter) to set your Twitter account information and preferences.


== Configuration ==

There are a few configuration options for Post to Twitter. You can find these in Options > Post to Twitter.

== Known Issues ==

* Only one Twitter account is supported (not one account per author).
* Tweets are not deleted from the tweet table in your WordPress database when they are deleted from Twitter. To delete from your WordPress database, use a database admin tool like phpMyAdmin.
* The relative date function isn't fully localized.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if I have both my tweets posting to my blog as posts and my posts sent to Twitter? Will it cause the world to end in a spinning fireball of death? = 

Actually, Post to Twitter has taken this into account and you can safely enable both creating posts from your tweets and tweets from your posts without duplicating them in either place.

That about does it - enjoy!
